	DESCRIPTION

	This file contains the definitions of CATIDs recognized by Inventor and its related products.
	A Third Party will decide which of these Categories to implement and will install its product
	registering itself as a standard ActiveX component. During its registration, it must use ActiveX's
	Category Manager to help register its Implemented Categories. It may also advertise Categories
	that it requires to be implemented by Inventor. But this latter, currently, is for future use.
