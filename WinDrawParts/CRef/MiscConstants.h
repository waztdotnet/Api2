/*
 * The Minor Versions of each of Inventor's public releases, including any Service
 * Packs. 
 *
 * Due to their defunct nature, the symbols for the constants have been modified (prefixed
 * by an underscore). This will force any code recompiling to take a hard look at switching
 * over to the new SoftwareVersion object that provides this same capability, but in a much
 * more supportable and understandable way. The SoftwareVersion object is obtainable from 
 * Inventor's Application or Apprentice Server's ApprenticeServer objects, respectively.
 * This list is maintained only upto R2 and provided purely for compatibility reasons.
