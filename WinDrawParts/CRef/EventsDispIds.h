  DESCRIPTION

  This file contains the definitions of DispIds of the various methods of the various eventsets
    supported by Inventor and its related products. Third Party programmers may require the knowledge
    of these DispIds while programming a C++ client application to receive these events. This is
    specially true when the Third Party is writing the 'sink' interfaces using ATL wizard to help
    generate the 'sink' interface code.
